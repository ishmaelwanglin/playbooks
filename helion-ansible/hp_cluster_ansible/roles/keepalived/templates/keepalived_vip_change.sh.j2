# A simple script triggered by keepalived when VIPs are moved
# around. When VIPs are moved to this node, explicit route for
# each VIP is added - this assures that any connection to VIP
# will use by default local-ipv4 as source address. Without this
# explicit route VIP address is used which causes issues when VIP
# moved to another node.
#
# When VIP is moved from this node, this explicit route is removed
# to allow proper routing from this node to new VIP node.
