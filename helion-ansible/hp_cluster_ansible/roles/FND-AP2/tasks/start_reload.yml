# This playbook is for use by any apache-hosted service. It ensures that
# the apache service is started and will optionally reload apache if the
# apache_reload_requested variable is set to true (default is false).
# If apache was either started or reloaded and the keystone site is enabled,
# keystone status is invoked to ensure that keystone is up and running
# before returning from this playbook.
