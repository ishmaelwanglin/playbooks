# Settings needed for accessing keystone admin
keystone_admin_port: 35357
# This should be changed to
# keystone_admin_ip: "{{ host | item('bind.KEY_API.admin.ip_address', d='*') }}"
# in the future but on such a change we need to trigger an apache restart
# instead of apache reload because apache does not like moving from hostname ->ip
# and then reloading, in this case it gives "bind address already in use"
keystone_admin_ip: "{{ host | item('vars.my_network_name', d='*') }}"
